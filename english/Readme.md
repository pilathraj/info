### Basics
- **Some** is often used to indicate an unspecified amount or number.
- **Of course** is used to express **strong agreement** or to indicate that something is obvious.
- In questions, **any** is often used to inquire if there is **at least one** of something.
- **Down the street** means further along the street or a **short distance away on the same street**.
- The expression **look who's here** is often used when you notice someone arriving or entering a place, especially when it's unexpected or a pleasant surprise.
- **How is everything?** is a way to ask someone how they are and how things are going in their life.
- By adding **-er** to a verb, you **create a noun** that describes a **person's job.** It doesn't apply to all professions but you'll see this pattern in many. Example, a programmer is someone who programs, a developer is someone who develops software or systems. Another example is a designer, who is a person that designs websites, graphics, or products.
- Program is a word that ends in **consonant, vowel, consonant** (-ram). In those cases what you want to do is to repeat the last consonant, in this case m, and add -er, **Programmer**.
- **Is there** and **are there** are used at the beginning of questions to ask about the existence or presence of something.
- Practicing the correct usage of is there and are there in questions is crucial. Remember, is there is used for singular nouns and are there for plural nouns. This task will help you understand how to form questions correctly using these phrases.
- **How about...?** is often used to ask for information about a topic or to make a suggestion. For example:
   - How about the coffee here? - This asks for someone's opinion about the coffee.
   - How about the meeting tomorrow? - This asks if there will be a meeting.
- The suffix **-ly** can be added to words to indicate the frequency of an event. Here's how it applies to different time periods:
   - Daily means it occurs once every day.
   - Weekly indicates something that happens once every week.
   - Monthly describes something that happens once every month.
   - Yearly (or annually) describes something that happens once every year.
- In a conversation, when you agree with someone but want to add more information, you can use **Yes, but...** to continue your point. For example:
   - Person 1: Will you join the team meeting?
   - Person 2: Yes, but only for the first 30 minutes. - This person agrees, but can't stay the whole time.
- These phrases can show that you agree with someone's point, or they can help you return to a topic that was mentioned earlier but not fully discussed. For example:
   - **For sure.** - Use this to agree in a friendly, informal way.
   - **Back to...** - Use this to return to a topic that was mentioned before.
- You can use **want to** to show desire or plans. For example:
   - I want to visit Paris next summer. - This means you hope to go there in the future.
   - He wants to learn guitar. - This means he plans or hopes to play guitar someday.
- The expression **only if** is used to set a condition for something to happen. It's like saying "this will happen if that happens". It's a way of making an agreement where one action depends on another.
   - For example, your friend might say, I'll go out only if it doesn't rain. It means they will go out but the weather must be good - no rain.
- **Personality Questions?**
   - **What is he/she like?** is used to ask about personality traits, such as being kind, intelligent, or funny.
   - **What does he/she look like?** is the question you would ask if you want to know about how someone looks, for example, if they are tall, have blonde hair, or wear glasses.
- **Usually** is a word that suggests that something happens often but is not constant.
   - When usually is used with the verb to be, it is placed after the verb.
   - For example, She is usually on time for meetings.
- The word **on** is a **preposition** that you can use to talk about specific days of the week, dates, and parts of the day (only when you mean a specific day) when something takes place. For example, on Tuesday, on July 4th, or on Friday night.
 
## Tense
### 1. Present Perfect
The **Present Perfect** is a tense used to indicate a link between the present and the past. The time of the action is before now but not specified, and the person using it is usually more interested in the result than in the action itself. For example:

I played this game yesterday. - This is in the **past simple tense**. It states that the action of playing the game happened at a specific time in the past, which is yesterday.

I have played this game before. - This is in the **present perfect tense**. It states that the action of playing the game happened at an unspecified time in the past.

I've played this game before. - This sentence is also in the present perfect tense, using the contraction I've for I have. Like the previous example, it states that the action of playing the game happened at an unspecified time in the past.
