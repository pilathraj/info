   - Smallest units in K8s
   - Abstruction over the container
   - You can only interact with kubernetes layers
   - Usually one application in a Pod
   - Each pod gets their own IP address
   - When Pod die, New IP address assign on re-creation
2. **Service:**
    - Pod's IP address might change on re-creation, to resolve IP-address changes, service component comes into the Picture.
    - Service is having static/permanent IP address
    - Life cycle of Pod & service is not connected, Means even pod die, Service ip address remains un-changed.
    - 2 types of services
        - Internal service  (ex, Database connection)
        - External service (ex,  access application on external browser)
