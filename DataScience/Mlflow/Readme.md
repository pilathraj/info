## Mlflow
MLflow is an open source platform to manage the ML lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, deployment, and a central model registry. MLflow currently offers four components:
1. MLflow Tracking
   - Record and query experiments: code, data, config, and results
2. MLflow Projects
   - Package data science code in a format to reproduce runs on any platform
3. MLflow Models
   - Deploy machine learning models in diverse serving environments
4. Model Registry
    - Store, annotate, discover, and manage models in a central repository
