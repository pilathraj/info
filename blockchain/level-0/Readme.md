### What is blockchain?
- **Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology (DLT)** This means that it is a database that is shared across a network of computers. Each computer on the network has a copy of the ledger, and any changes to the ledger must be approved by all of the computers on the network.
- **Blockchain is a chain of blocks** Each block in the chain contains a record of transactions. The blocks are linked together using cryptography, which means that it is very difficult to change or hack the blockchain.
- **Blockchain is a secure technology** The distributed nature of the blockchain makes it very difficult to attack. Any attempt to change the blockchain would require the attacker to control more than 50% of the computers on the network.
- **Blockchain is a transparent technology** All of the transactions on the blockchain are public and can be viewed by anyone. This makes it a very transparent and auditable system.

#### Blockchain technology has a number of potential applications, including:

- **Financial transactions:** Blockchain can be used to record financial transactions, such as payments and investments. This can help to make financial transactions more secure and transparent.
- **Supply chain management:** Blockchain can be used to track the movement of goods and materials throughout the supply chain. This can help to improve efficiency and transparency.
- **Voting:** Blockchain can be used to create a more secure and transparent voting system. This can help to reduce voter fraud and increase voter participation.
- **Land registry:** Blockchain can be used to create a more secure and transparent land registry. This can help to reduce fraud and improve efficiency.
