## Blockchain
- Bitcoin first blockchain protocol
- Ethereum 2015.
- Ethereum add Smart contract
- Smart contract written code and execute in the Dapps.
- Smart contract revolutionaries techonology.
- Oracles help to get real world data, do external computation/data.
- Hybrid smart contract with oracle.  
- Dapp = Smart Contract = Decentralized App
- Ethereum Difi, layer2, etc..
- Ethereum platform - Most power
- Chainlink
- Decentrailzed network  
- Transparency and Flexibility
- Speed & Efficiency
- Scurity & Immutability
- Removal of counterparty risk
- Trust Minimized Agreements
-  DAOs - Decentralised authorised Organisation

  ## Ethereum

   - **Test net** - currency does not have any real value, test network
   - **Mainnet** - It's Prod, it's hoiding live currency.
   - **Faucet** -Is an application that gives us the free test tokens, like free test Rinkeby Ethereum.
   - **Block Explorer** - An Application that allows us to view transactions that happen on a blockchain.
   - **Gas** - Gas is a unit of computational measure. The more computation a transaction uses the more gas you have to pay for Every transcation that happens on-chain pays a "gas fee" to node operators.
   - Then amount of "gas" used and how much you pay depends on how "computationally expensive" your transcation is sending ETH to 1 address would be "cheaper" than sending ETH to 1000 addresses.
   - **Gas**: Measure of computation use
   - **Gas Price**: How much it costs per unit of gas
   - **Gas Limit**: Max amount of gas in a transcation
   - **Transaction Fee:** Gas Used * Gas Price
   - ie. 21000 gas @ 1 GWEI per gas = 21000 GWEI
   - Gas Price is based off the "demand" of the blockchanin.
   - The more people want to make transcations, the higher the gas price and therefore the higher the transcation fees.

### Concepts
- **Hash**: A unique fixed length string, meant to identify a piece of data. They are created by placing said data into a "hash function".
- **Genesis Block**: The first block in a blockchanin
- **Hash Algorithm**: A function that computes data into a unique hash.
- **Minining**: The process of finding the solution to the blockchain problem.
- In our example, the problem was to find a hash that starts with 0000 zeros.
- Nodes get paid for the mining blocks
- **Decentralized**: No single point of authority.
- **Nonce**:
- A number used once to find the solution to the blockchain problem.
- It's also used to define the transcation number for an account/address.
- **Private Key**: Only known to the key holder, it's used to sign transactions.
- **Public Key**: Is derived from your private key, Anyone can see it, and use it to verify that a transation came from you.
