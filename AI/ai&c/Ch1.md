## Define AI ? 
AI is described as a universal field with solutions in many subfields, which has led to many possible definitions as the field has been evolving. 
These solutions span areas such as:
• Problem Solving, e.g., playing chess.
• Understanding human language, e.g., Alexa.
• Understanding Vision, e.g., Face Recognition.
• Extracting patterns from data, e.g., Fraud detection and other Machine Learning (ML) algorithms.
• Robotics, e.g., Driving Vehicles.
