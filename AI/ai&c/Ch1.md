## Define AI ? 
AI is described as a universal field with solutions in many subfields, which has led to many possible definitions as the field has been evolving. 
These solutions span areas such as:
- Problem Solving, e.g., playing chess.
- Understanding human language, e.g., Alexa.
- Understanding Vision, e.g., Face Recognition.
- Extracting patterns from data, e.g., Fraud detection and other Machine Learning (ML) algorithms.
- Robotics, e.g., Driving Vehicles.

### Categorization of AI Definitions
To manage the diversity of possible definitions, the sources categorize them along two primary dimensions:

**Dimension 1: Thought / Reasoning vs. Acting**
1. Thought / Reasoning: Defined as a series of brain states that can be experimentally or introspectively observed in a human brain while solving a problem.
2. Acting: Defined as performing an interaction with an environment, such as making a move in chess or taking a left turn while driving a car.

**Dimension 2: Human Performance vs. Rationality**
1. Rationality: Defined as being right all the time.
2. Human Performance: Defined as a standard that is not always perfect (e.g., not all chess players are grandmasters)
